A student gave a presentation on Web Application Security which included a demonstration of Mutillidae. It was quite successful and we had many people start playing with webapp secuirty afterwards.  

Websites to practice web application security on are:

* [HackThisSite](http://www.hackthissite.org/)
* [EnigmaGroup](http://www.enigmagroup.org/)
* [OWASP Challenges](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Hackademic_Challenges_Project)
* [Mutillidae](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mutillidae/)
* [Hack.me](https://hack.me/)
