<b>Student Linux User Group (SLUG)</b>: Anything and everything Linux! Whether you're a beginner or advanced, all are welcome. SLUG is always talking about something nerdy and it's usually a lot of fun. This year SLUG hopes to have a couple of Linux Workshops to introduce Linux to other students and hopefully get them hooked. SLUG also runs most of the ACM servers and has many connections into the CECS department servers.
<br>
<b>Cyber Defense</b>: Information Security, Network Security, Sys-admin, and a whole host of other topics are discussed here. This is a great opportunity to learn a lot of different skills that are very valuable in today's world. It's a great club to expand your skills, do a little hacking, and defend yourself. The group also provides a Cyber Defense competition for a Business School class as their final. The end goal of the club is to compete in the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition and bring home the National trophy. The competition is late in the Spring semester with many fun mini-competitions along the way. The group went to Regionals just a few months ago and placed 5th!

<b>Game Development</b>: Learn to make some games! This is a fun club to get started in game programming. If you've always wanted to try it, but never knew where to start, you'll fit in perfectly here. This club has always struggled to maintain membership, but lets make this year different! Maybe you'll make the next Minecraft (or whatever game is popular these days among you youngin's.)
<br>
<b>Hacking</b>: You probably think that we are the people you don’t want touching your computers or networks. But really we’re the kinds of people that made your computers and networks possible. From hardware to software and everything in between, we take bits from here and there and put them together to make the greatest of things possible. Also we do hackathons and workshops.
Hardware Hacking, Software hacking, everything in between hacking… We make our ideas and dreams realities with computers and bring those realities to the wonderful forum of everyone else who is doing the same kinds of things. We go to hackathons (which are 24-36 hour events of dream -> reality) we do hack days(same thing, but 12 hours) and we spend time learning and discussing methods for all of these things, including doing things like workshops and seminars on the infinite possibilities of hacking.
