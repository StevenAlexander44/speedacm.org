In the Game Development SIG we make games!

In our meetings we help each other code, design, and create to learn the game development process and hopefully have a fun project to show for it. 
No experience is needed, and if youâ€™re interested in learning coding, game design and game art this is the place! 
We are currently working on a top-down twin stick shooter within the Godot engine.

Join the #gamedev channel in our discord for more info!
Meetings for Summer 2022 are on Wednesdays at 7PM
