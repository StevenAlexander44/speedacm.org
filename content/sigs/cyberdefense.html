We go over topics such as hardening Linux and Windows, best computer practices, and Over the Wire exercises. One of our main focuses is the CCDC team competition. The team competes as a blue team defending a network of systems against a group of professional red team players. In 2021 the team placed 1st at state qualifiers and 4th in the region. 

The group also gets involved with Capture the Flag competitions like the NCL competition. This has 11 categories and the goal is to complete the challenges to find a hidden “flag.”
